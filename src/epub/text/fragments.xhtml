				<p>These Fragments are entitled “<i xml:lang="la">Epicteti Fragmenta maxime ex Ioanne Stobaeo, Antonio, et Maximo collecta</i>” (<abbr>ed.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr>). There are some notes and emendations on the Fragments; and a short dissertation on them by Schweighaeuser.</p>
				<p>Nothing is known of Stobaeus nor of his time, except the fact that he has preserved some extracts of an ethical kind from the New Platonist Hierocles, who lived about the middle of the fifth century <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr>; and it is therefore concluded that Stobaeus lived after Hierocles. The fragments attributed to Epictetus are preserved by Stobaeus in his work entitled <i xml:lang="grc">Ἁνφολόγιον</i>, or Florilegium or Sermones.</p>
				<p>Antonius Monachus, a Greek monk, also made a Florilegium, entitled Melissa (the bee). His date is uncertain, but it was certainly much later than the time of Stobaeus.</p>
				<p>Maximus, also named the monk, and reverenced as a saint, is said to have been a native of Constantinople, and born about <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 580.</p>
				<p>Some of the Fragments contained in the edition of Schweighaeuser are certainly not from Epictetus. Many of the fragments are obscure; but they are translated as accurately as I can translate them, and the reader must give to them such meaning as he can.</p>

				<p>Freedom and slavery, the one is the name of virtue, and the other of vice: and both are acts of the will. But where there is no will, neither of them touches (affects) these things.

				<p>They are amusing fellows, said he (Epictetus), who are proud of the things which are not in our power. A man says, I am better than you, for I possess much land, and you are wasting with hunger. Another says, I am of consular rank. Another says, I am a Procurator (<i xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτροπος</i>). Another, I have curly hair. But a horse does not say to a horse, I am superior to you, for I possess much fodder, and much barley, and my bits are of gold and my harness is embroidered: but he says, I am swifter than you. And every animal is better or worse from his own merit (virtue) or his own badness. Is there then no virtue in man only? and must we look to the hair, and our clothes and to our ancestors?</p>

				<p>Examine yourself whether you wish to be rich or to be happy. If you wish to be rich, you should know that it is neither a good thing nor at all in your power: but if you wish to be happy, you should know that it is both a good thing and in your power, for the one is a temporary loan of fortune, and happiness comes from the will.</p>

				<p>As when you see a viper or an asp or a scorpion in an ivory or golden box, you do not on account of the costliness of the material love it or think it happy, but because the nature of it is pernicious, you turn away from it and loathe it; so when you shall see vice dwelling in wealth and in the swollen fulness of fortune, be not struck by the splendour of the material, but despise the false character of the morals.</p>

				<p>Wealth is not one of the good things; great expenditure is one of the bad; moderation (<i xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</i>)is one of the good things.

But if such behaviour be unsuitable to the occasion, remember that you are served when you are not labouring by those who are labouring, when you are eating by those who are not eating, when you are drinking by those who are not drinking, while you are talking by those who are silent, while you are at ease by those who are under constraint; and if you remember this, you will neither being heated with anger be guilty of any absurdity yourself, nor by irritating another will you cause any mischief.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>

				<p>Grasshoppers (cicadae) are musical: snails have no voice. Snails have pleasure in being moist, but grasshoppers in being dry. Next the dew invites forth the snails and for this they crawl out: but on the contrary the sun when he is hot, rouses the grasshoppers and they sing in the sun. Therefore if you wish to be a musical man and to harmonize well with others, when over the cups the soul is bedewed with wine, at that time do not permit the soul to go forth and to be polluted; but when in company (parties) it is fired by reason, then bid her to matter oracular words and to sing the oracles of justice.</p>

And indeed nature has given to me modesty, and I blush much when I think of saying any thing base (indecent).

				<p>[In poverty any man lives (can live) happily, but very seldom in wealth and power (<i xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαῖς</i>). The value of poverty excels so much that no just man (<i xml:lang="grc">νόμιμος</i>) would exchange poverty for disreputable wealth, unless indeed the richest of the Athenians Themistocles, the son of Neocles, was better than Aristides and Socrates, though he was poor in virtue. But the wealth of Themistocles and Themistocles himself have perished and have left no name. For all things die with death in a bad man, but the good is eternal.]<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a></p>

				<p>Remember that such was, and is, and will be the nature of the universe, and that it is not possible that the things which come into being can come into being otherwise than they do now; and that not only men have participated in this change and transmutation, and all other living things which are on the earth, but also the things which are divine. And indeed the very four elements are changed and transmuted up and down, and earth becomes water and water becomes air, and the air again is transmuted into other things, and the same manner of transmutation takes place from above to below. If a man attempts to turn his mind towards these thoughts, and to persuade himself to accept with willingness that which is necessary, he will pass through life with complete moderation and harmony.</p>

				<p>All things obey and serve the world (the universe), earth and sea and sun and the rest of the stars, and the plants of earth and animals. And our body obeys it also both in disease and in health when it (the universe) chooses, both in youth and in age, and when it is passing through the other changes. What is reasonable then and in our power is this, for our judgment not to be the only thing which resists it (the universe): for it is strong and superior, and it has determined better about us by administering (governing) us also together with the whole. And besides, this opposition also is unreasonable and does nothing more than cause us to be tormented uselessly and to fall into pain and sorrow.</p>

					<p>Of the things which are, God has put some of them in our power, and some he has not. In our own power he has placed that which is the best and the most important, that indeed through which he himself is happy, the use of appearances (<i xml:lang="grc">φαντασιῶν</i>). For when this use is rightly employed, there is freedom, happiness, tranquillity, constancy: and this is also justice and law, and temperance, and every virtue. But all other things he has not placed in our power. Wherefore we also ought to be of one mind with God, and making this division of things, to look after those which are in our power; and of the things not in our power, to intrust them to the Universe (<i xml:lang="grc">τῷ κόσμῳ</i>), and whether it should require our children, or our country, or our body, or any thing else, willingly to give them up.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a></p>

Do you not see that it was with no nobler voice that Polus acted the part of Oedipus as king than of Oedipus as a wanderer and beggar at Colonus? Then shall the good man appear to be inferior to Polus, and unable to act well every character (personage) im- posed on him by the Deity? and shall he not imitate Ulysses, who even in rags made no worse figure than in the soft purple robe?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-51" id="noteref-51" epub:type="noteref">51</a></p>

For these things are perhaps incomprehensible to the human mind: and if any man should even suppose them to be in the highest degree comprehensible, what then is the profit of them, if they are comprehended? And must we not say that those men have needless trouble who assign these things as necessary to the philosopher’s discourse? Is then also the precept written at Delphi superfluous, which is Know thyself? It is not so, he says. What then is the meaning of it? If a man gave to a choreutes (member of chorus) the precept to know himself, would he not have observed in the precept that he must direct his attention to himself?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-52" id="noteref-52" epub:type="noteref">52</a></p>

Itaque,” inquit, “si quis haec duo verba cordi habeat, eaque sibi imperando atque observando curet, is erit pleraque impeccabilis vitamque vivet tranquillissimam. Verba duo haec dicebat, <i xml:lang="grc">Ἀνέχου καὶ Ἀπέχου</i>.”</p>
